# Graphviewer
A good way to create your graphs and understand some standard algorithms on them.

# Requirements
- Processing 3.0
- Proscene 3.0

# How to use
1. Install Proscene in processing.
2. Run graphviewer.
3. Commands:
* 'n' : add a node on a click position.
* 'e' : add an edge between two nodes.
* '1', '2', '3' : go between different algorithms implemented.
* ' ' : runs current algorithm on current graph.
* 'p' : pause animation.
* 'r' : reset graph to the initial values.
* 'd' : set edges in directed mode.
* 'b' : set edges in bidirectional mode.
