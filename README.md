# Graphviewer
A good way to create your graphs and understand some standard algorithms on them.

# Requirements
- Processing 3.0
- Proscene 3.0

# How to use
1. Install Proscene in processing.
2. Run graphviewer.
3. Commands:
* 'n' : add a node on a click position.
* 'e' : add an edge between two nodes.
* '1', '2', '3' : go between different algorithms implemented.
* 'd' : runs DFS on current graph.
* 'b' : runs BFS on current graph.
* 'j' : runs Dijkstra's Algorithm on current graph.
* 'r' : reset graph to the initial values.
